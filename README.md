# Hi, I'm Nischal Kashyap

I'm a Computer Science Engineer with a deep interest in building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems at scale. My work spans applied AI, full-stack development, and systems engineering, with a focus on creating tools that are both powerful and intuitive.

Currently, I'm an AI Engineer Intern at Aimplify Technologies, where I designed and deployed a production-ready, full-stack AI analytics platform. Before that, I interned at Graymatics, working on deep learning models for video surveillance and semantic segmentation.

I enjoy taking ideas from concept to production. Whether it's building data agents that turn CSVs into conversation, or creating calendar-integrated study planners, I care about delivering systems that make life easier, smarter, and more efficient.

## ðŸš€ Highlights

- **AI-Powered Platforms**: Architected and deployed Langchain-based data analysis systems that let users interact with their datasets using natural language, delivering insights through visualizations.
- **Computer Vision & Deep Learning**: Built and optimized deep learning pipelines for object detection and semantic segmentation using YOLOv8, DeepLabv3+, and MMSegmentation.
- **Full-Stack Engineering**: From REST APIs with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy to React frontends and MySQL backends, I enjoy building across the stack to deliver seamless user experiences.
- **Applied Research Projects**: Developed tools for crowd density analysis, plagiarism detection, music genre classification, and stock market prediction.

## ðŸ§  What Iâ€™m Good At

- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, Java, Flask, FastAPI, Django, React
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: PyTorch, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, YOLO, MMSegmentation, Langchain
- **Tools & Infrastructure**: Git, SQLAlchemy, MySQL, Jupyter, Google APIs, OAuth2, Docker (familiar)
- **Problem Solving**: Hackathon winner, passionate about building things that work and scale
